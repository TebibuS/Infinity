## Summary

Infinity is an android app thatdisplays random image of the NASA photo of the day and cats

>

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [* ] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ *] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ ]* A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [* ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query



## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=qivKyztKg9cEI2vZZYua5Tw77dJgFAfAXksiOPqA and "https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search"
